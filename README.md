# Alzheimers-Risk-Prediction
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to genetic variant data for exploring genetic disease risk prediction. Using ClinVar-filtered Alzheimerâ€™s-related SNPs, synthetic genotype data was simulated for 1,000 individuals. Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained to classify individuals as at-risk or non-risk.
